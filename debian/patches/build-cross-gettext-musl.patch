Description: Fix cross-compilation on musl-based systems.
 The gettext implementation in musl does not define some of the internal
 symbols that AM_GNU_GETTEXT used to check for. This got fixed in gettext
 0.19.8, but the AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION macro requires a specific version
 even if the system contains a higher one. We switch to use the new
 AM_GNU_GETTEXT_REQUIRE_VERSION macro which requires at least a specific
 version, and bump the AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION to the first one that had
 support for the new macro.
